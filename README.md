# MyPlayers
The app MyPlayers lets the user stay informed about tennis playersâ€™ scores and about tennis tournaments that are going on.
It enables to select tennis players to track and view those players' latest scores, which are updated daily.
It also sends notifications to inform the user when the selected players areplaying, which tournament is currently going on,
and who won each tournament.
This project is unfinished and many of the classes have not been implemented yet. It does not have tests.
